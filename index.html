		<p>
			Welcome to the homepage of that most reputed publication, known to most as "The Indus Dispatch".
			This being primarily an archive of all editions of The Indus Dispatch since August of 2020, you'll 
			also find additional resources, and portals for contributing, or giving feedback.
		</p>

		<p>
			With what resources we're given, we endeavour to provide a somewhat entertaining read to our
			various patrons, who exceed the tens in number. Through academic pressures, and sub-zero pay, 
			we struggle on, in pursuit of that paradigm of pseudo-academic literary perfection. Just how far
			can one stray from academics before ceasing to be a school newsletter, in the strictest sense?
			Every day, we explore this question.
		</p>

		<p>
			Anyone who has already read a previous publication of ours will have heard our call for aid before,
			but we repeat it here: we need your articles, and more than that, you need your articles.A wise man
			once advised the general population to strive to become the change they'd be happy to see around them,
			and along similar lines, we encourage you to write for the newsletter what you'd like to see in it.
		</p>

		<p>
			For the finely-attuned individuals among out ranks, we have made it possible to submit works
			anonymously, so you needn't worry about readers, or for that matter, even us, learning anything
			of you. Let your work speak for itself, and all that.
		</p>

		<p>
			If this proves too much, or you simply find yourself unable to churn out a single word, you might
			send us a line, and tell us what it is you'd like to see us publish. 
		</p>

		<p>
			All editions contained in these archives were produced under the management of Aarush Kumbhakern
			(Compiler/Primary Editor), Naimish Kandula (Managing Editor), and Chollangi Sri Tejasvi and Dyuti 
			Peddada (Correspondence Managers).
